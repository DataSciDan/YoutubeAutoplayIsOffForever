# Youtube Autoplay is Off Forever #

***With thanks to Alice Cooper***

----------

As soon as the entire page and all the content loads, YAiOF turns autoplay off. You can even watch it happen.

Currently supported:
-Everthing Chromium-based, like Google Chrome and Brave Browser

Soon supported:
-Everything Firefox-based, like Firefox, Tor Browser, and GNU IceCat
-Greasemonkey

## The YAiOF manifesto ##
1. You, the user, decide how your browser behaves (See Freedom 0 of Free Software).
2. You, the user, decide precisely when to navigate away from a page.
3. You, the user, decide what media you will consume.
4. Treachery is not to be tolerated.

## License ##
Because the code is so short and basically generic, I've published Youtube Autoplay is Off Forever under The Unlicense, which is equivalent to placing it in the public domain and even functions to grant all users who are in countries where the public domain isn't legally recognized the same usage and modify rights as public domain works have elsewhere.

If you're going to use (with or without modification) the icons I made for this addon, it would be very nice of you to attribute it this addon, unless doing so would be inconvenient. Just say
>This picture is the icon for the browser addon Youtube Autoplay is Off Forever, which you can get it at https://github.com/DataSciDan/YoutubeAutoplayIsOffForever
or something thereabouts.

### Disclaimer ###
Yes, the name of this add-on includes the word, "forever." However, There is no way to make absolutely certain that this extension works literally forever. That's one of the reasons it's released under a free software license.

### Notice ###
Neither Youtube Autoplay is Off Forever nor it's developer are in anyway affiliate with YouTube, Google LLC, or Alphabet Inc.
